## How to build

 - 3. Open the Makefile in the resources folder in a code editor
 - 4. Modify the MUZZLE_PATH variable to where ever you installed Muzzle to
 - 5. Copy this Makefile to any root of any project that is using Muzzle, For now we will just copy over our new Makefile to the examples/Applet folder.
